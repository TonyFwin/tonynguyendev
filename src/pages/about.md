HI I'm Tony. I'm a front-end developer based out of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

> There's nothing more permanent than a temporary hack. - Kyle Simpson

I'm a front end developer at Epicosity. I am primarily interested in working with JavaScript, specifically ReactJS and Node.JS. I have a beautiful wife, a dog and two cats. I love gaming, weight lifting and travelling. I'm a big metalhead and hiphophead I love going to shows and seeing people perform.

_Thank You for reading!_
