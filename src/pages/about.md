I'm a front end developer based out of the Twin Cities.

> There's nothing more permanent than a temporary hack. - Kyle Simpson
I work primarily with JavaScript, Vue.JS and TailwindCSS. I have experience with Node, React, PHP, Flutter, Kotlin, and Swift.

I enjoy working with plants, dabbling in guitar, going for a run or lifting some weights. Inspired by hiphop, folk, and metalcore music. Recovering diet soda addict.
