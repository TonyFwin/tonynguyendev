A simple NodeJs and Express application I made while learning Node. The application uses the [mapbox.com](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/) and [darksky.net](https://darksky.net/dev) api's, as well as [handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/)for a template system.  The code for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/TonyFwin/node-weather-website). You can view the application [here](https://nguyen-application-weather.herokuapp.com/).
